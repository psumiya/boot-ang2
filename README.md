# Hello to Angular 2 with Spring Boot 
This project presents a simple way to deploy a compiled and built Angular 2 application on Tomcat using Spring. 
The project uses Spring Boot as it already provides a lot of automation with respect to getting up and running with a deployable web application. The Angular 2 application being used here is based on the 5-minute quickstart guide created by the Angular 2 team.
